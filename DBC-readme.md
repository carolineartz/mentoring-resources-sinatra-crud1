# P1 Sinatra Restful Crud 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Implement CRUD in a MVC application (using Sinatra)
* Use Active Record to perform CRUD operations on a database
* Use RESTful routes

##Summary 

Using Sinatra, create a simple notes application with a single notes table in the database and all [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) routes and views.  

You can start from the included skeleton.

##Releases

###Release 0 : RESTful CRUD


Modify the skeleton code to achieve the following functionality:

1. A user Create a new note.  
2. A user can Read all the notes created.
3. A user can Update a note. 
4. A user can Delete an existing note. 
5. Verify that a user really wants to delete a particular note. 

Your note table should have a `title` and `content` field.  You should use [RESTful routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) for each operation. 


### Release 1 : Add Partials 
Use Partials to convert your page to a single page application.
